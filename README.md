To-Do List Application (with Priority Management)
This is a simple but improved To-Do List application built using Python and Tkinter. The application allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, removing, and sorting tasks by priority. The tasks are stored in an SQLite database to persist across sessions.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can input tasks with an assigned priority (1-5).
Edit Tasks: You can edit the priority of any existing task.
Delete Tasks: Tasks can be removed individually or all at once.
Task Sorting: Tasks are automatically sorted by priority (low to high).
Persistent Storage: All tasks are saved in an SQLite database.
User Interface: Built with Tkinter, providing a simple yet attractive graphical interface.
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following:

Python 3.x or higher
SQLite (comes pre-installed with Python)
Tkinter (also comes pre-installed with Python)
